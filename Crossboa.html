                alt="Ah, yes. Slime. The favoured prey of a snake. Most of our assets were from itch.io, though not all of them were initially animated in a way that we liked. We made a few alterations here and there to get some satisfying results.">
            <p>Crossboa is a <strong>2d action roguelike</strong> that takes place within an ancient temple. Slithering
                around in the forest, you've discovered an old temple deep within the trees. Within its walls was a
                small crossbow. As a snake does, you decided to pick it up. Suddenly, you felt the floor begin to
                tremble! The walls behind you began to rise as a horde of monsters flooded in to defend the temple.
                Luckily, the crossbow came with an arrow! Only one, though. And can you even use it without any arms?
                You can probably make it work.</p>
            <p>This game was created in the <strong>MonoGame</strong> engine, which is an offshoot of the
                <strong>Xna</strong> framework. This project was made in a group of 4 people as part of an introductory
                programming course for <strong>C#</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Timeframe:</strong> February 2022 - April 2022</p>

        <h1>Development</h1>
        <img src="media/ClassArchitecture.png" id="architecture"
            alt="Our original idea was to have all objects be childs of the GameObject class, and then having system managers to help control them. This is essentially what ended up happening, but with a lot more managers and communication between classes.">
        <p>Our class architecture was well thought out, and really helped us in the early stages of the project. As this
            project started early in the course, we naturally learned about more features of both MonoGame and C++, so
            this doesn't represent what our game looked like by the end of development. Some classes were culled of
            content through the use of interfaces and structs, while in other cases it was decided that more specialized
            child objects of game classes were necessary to give more function to different objects. Such was the case
            with projectiles and level tiles. Very early on, we also ended up creating a Physics Manager, to round out a
            trio of managers to aid the game loop, with the later additions of a Stats, Sound, Spawn, and Camara
            managers. In retrospect we did have a pretty good idea of the complexity that each class would have, and all
            the functions we predicted we would need, we did need, along with a few more added to most classes for
            various reasons. We did have some suprises even in that regard. We expected the Collision Manger to be our
            largest and most complicated class, and it did come at least 2nd in that regard. The Level Manager became a
            monster and ended up quadrupling it's size. It would have been even larger if we didn't decide to have a
            separate Spawn Manager. The only part of our architecture that was removed altogether was the GameManager
            class, as all of it's contents ended up being either better suited to being tracked by other classes, or
            better suited to being decided by polymorphism.</p>



        <img src="media/StateMachine.png" id="states"
            alt="Deciding the game loop early on helped cut down on what could have been a lot of trial and error. I can only imagine the bugs we would have had to tackle. The Game Win Screen was eventually removed as the game became infinite, and functionality was added to go from the Pause Screen to the Main Menu.">
        <p>Figuring out how the game would actually work was an entirely separate challenge, though we quickly found
            that finite state machines were integral in keeping everything well organized. This applied to the core
            gameplay loop as well, and we took care to figure out which options the player would have at each stage of
            the game. This helped us to catch bugs before they happened and prevented us from losing track of the
            direction of the game.</p>



        <p>Communication was key in making sure everything went as planned. We organized a time to meet in person each
            week and work on the game toghether. That's where we made big decisions and planned out the direction of the
            game. Most of the game was developed on our own time, seperately. All of our files were kept in github to
            allow everyone access to anything. The main way we kept track of our progress was through Trello, which is a
            list-making and organization board. We kept track of what would need to be done over time, and could add or
            remove details as plans changed. Each of us could also claim ownership of a task, which prevented two people
            from working on the same thing. It made development of the game simple and efficient.</p>

        <h1>Role</h1>
        <p>For this project, I worked as one of two main programmers (though all 4 of us programmed some parts of it),
            and partially as a designer. Most of what I did was based around Collision and Level managment. I
            programmed, the Collion Manager, Level Manager, and Spawn Manager and all of their functions. This includes,
            the organization of rooms, the spawning of enemies, loading in level configurations from text files,
            spawning and destroying doors, and creating a screen transition with the camera. All of these systems had
            different challenges and nuances as well, such as making sure enemies can't spawn in the immediate vicinity
            of a door the player is entering. I also handles difficulty scaling as the player progresses through the
            game by limiting more difficult enemies in the early stages and restricting how many can spawn on each
            stage. I also generally handled code cleanup and optimization throughout most of the classes.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above, I also created the Sound Manager, and was in charge of all music and sfx located
            within the game. This was a relatively simple process, with most of the work being optimizing files sizes.
            All music and sfx were pulled from and credited to users on Itch.io, with the exception of the title theme:
            <a href="#" id="ogg">Canopy Cacophony</a>, which I composed and edited myself. In addition to sound, I used
            text files to save players settings after closing and reopening the game.</p>
