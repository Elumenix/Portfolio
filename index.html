                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>Hello! My name is Donovan and I am currently a programmer / game designer pursuing a path in the
                        games industry. I've had experience with a bit of everything but my main focus is on programming
                        and software development.</p>

                  <p>I am constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to push myself creatively. Whether
                        it's brainstorming ideas for a new game concept or fine-tuning the mechanics of an existing
                        project, I am always eager to dive in and explore new possibilities.</p>

                  <p>I am currently a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, class of 2025, persuing a BS in Game
                        Desingn & Development.</p>

                  <p>I am excited to continue developing my skills as a game designer and to collaborate with other
                        creative professionals to bring new and innovative gaming experiences to players around the
                        world.</p>

                                                <p>This game was created in a small team of 4 people as part of a game
                                                      design course. As the only Game Design and Development major in
                                                      the group, I ended up designing a large portion of the gameplay
                                                      loop and gave feedback on classes and mechanics other team members
                                                      designed for the experience. I also played a large part in the
                                                      organization and proofreading of our documents and rules, which
                                                      helped to keep the group largely organized and focused on the

                                                <p>Being built in MonoGame, most elements of the game are made from
                                                      scratch, as there is little support native to MonoGame outside of
                                                      tracking time and uploading sprites. I programmed in my own system
                                                      for running animations and collisions so that the game could
                                                      function as intended, something that became leagues more
                                                      complicated when I made the decision to have slopes. I also
                                                      created a system for parallaxing the background infinitely, which
                                                      ended up being much harder than expected. The environment was
                                                      designed in Tiled, which is an open source program for building
                                                      levels with tilesets. All levels are imported to MonoGame through
                                                      text files, which I read in to decide what tiles are placed in the
                                                      world and the properties of each tile.</p>
                                                <p>This project went on hold when as my life became more busy and there
                                                      wasn't time to make substantial progress on it. The main problem
                                                      is that creating stages in tiled takes a massive amount of time
                                                      for 1 person. When I return to this project, my first steps will
                                                      be working on procedural level generation to (hopefully) speed up
                                                      the rate at which I can work on this game.</p>

                                                <p>This project started out as a class coding project but quickly turned
                                                      into a personal one. The main goals were the programming of
                                                      autonomous agents and pathfinding. State machines are used to
                                                      control ship behavior, with each state having it's own unique set
                                                      of behaviors relateed to ally and enemy ships to make them orbit,
                                                      travel, and battle in realistic ways. Progress has been good so
                                                      far and I hope to begin making levels once enemy's begin to behave

                                          <p>Spaceway Skirmish sees you fighting of the front lines of a stellar
                                                conflict. Seeking only glory, you venture out to make scrap metal of all
                                                ships that would dare oppose you. Whether it be enemy ships or the
                                                kepler belt, you won't stop fighting until someone takes you down for
                                                good.

                                          <p>Spaceway Skirmish class project whos primary goal was the introduction to
                                                the Unity Engine. The goal was to make a shoot-em-up with a score
                                                system. The only real requirenments were to have enemies and be able to
                                                fight them, so I wen't pretty far beyond the goal to involve parallaxing
                                                and animations, which let me gain a general understanding of the sprite
                                                editor and workflow. The most complex thing I did was create a system so
                                                that no enemies would overlap, which involved writing a sorting
                                                algorithm to put them in order so that it could quickly be identified
                                                where open space was. All things considered it is a relatively small
                                                project but it helped build a greater understanding for how to program
                                                with components, as compared to the hierarchical nightmare I was used to
                                                with MonoGame.
