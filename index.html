                  <h2>About Me</h2>
                  <p>Hello! My name is Donovan. I am currently a programmer/game designer pursuing a path in the games
                        industry. I've had experience with a bit of everything, but my main focus is on programming and
                        software development.</p>

                  <p>I am constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities to push myself creatively. Whether
                        it's brainstorming ideas for a new game concept or fine-tuning the mechanics of an existing
                        project, I am always eager to dive in and explore new possibilities.</p>

                  <p>I am a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, class of 2025, pursuing a BS in Game Design &
                        Development.</p>

                  <p>I am excited to continue developing my skills as a game designer and collaborating with other
                        creative professionals to bring new and innovative gaming experiences to players.</p>

                        <p>Artista is a grid-based competitive adventure board game with an emphasis on violence and
                              cruelty. Players race to complete their masterpieces and become the Artista, the most
                              powerful and cutthroat creative in the city of Chiaroscuro. To get to this point, however,
                              they must hold a tight grasp on their sanity and find inspiration to get ahead of their
                              rivals.

                        <p>This game was created by a small team of 4 people as part of a game design course. As the
                              only Game Design and Development major in the group, I designed a large portion of the
                              gameplay loop and provided feedback on classes and mechanics other team members designed
                              for the experience. I also played a large part in the organization and proofreading of our
                              documents and rules, which helped keep the group organized and focused on the content of
                              the game.</p>

                                    given a variety of options to the user for how their art should be displayed, and I
                                    save their generated pieces to local storage so that they can easily be brought back
                                    up later in the sidebar. This is something that I've found fun to experiment with.

                              <p>The main goals of this project were to learn to use API and internal storage, and how
                                    to create an interface for these things so that users can interact with them
                                    effectively. I feel I did a good job with this and everyone I've shown it to has
                                    responded with interest.</p>
                              <p>Above are some examples of what I've been able to create with it, featuring some of my
                                    favorite games. Try changing your browser width and see how clear the images look at

                        <p>Evergreen Escapades side-view action platformer, where the player battles enemies while
                              traveling from town to town, earning money to upgrade their equipment and train new
                              abilities. Time is always moving forward, changing the threats you face as day transitions
                              to night.</p>

                        <p>Being built in MonoGame, most elements of the game are made from scratch, as there is little
                              support native to MonoGame outside of tracking time and uploading sprites. I programmed in
                              my own system for running animations and collisions so that the game could function as
                              intended, something that became leagues more complicated when I decided to have slopes. I
                              also created a system for parallaxing the background infinitely, which ended up being much
                              harder than expected. The environment was designed in Tiled, which is an open-source
                              program for building levels with tilesets. All levels are imported to MonoGame through
                              text files, which I read in to decide what tiles are placed in the world and the
                              properties of each tile.</p>
                        <p>This project went on hold as my life became busier and there wasn't time to make substantial
                              progress on it. The main problem is that creating stages in tiled takes a massive amount
                              of time for 1 person. When I return to this project, my first steps will be working on
                              procedural level generation to (hopefully) speed up the rate at which I can work on this
                              game.</p>

                        <p>Confrontation is gearing up to be a story of galactic conquest against your enemies. The
                              player takes control of planets and wages intergalactic battle to take over the universe,
                              one solar system at a time. Quick thinking and solid tactics are expected from a great
                              leader and will be required to gain the upper hand against enemies.</p>
                        <p>Confrontation is a real-time strategy game based on resource and territory management. The
                              player will take control of planets and generate income from each one they control, which
                              they can, in turn, spend to increase troop production or capacity on each of their
                              controlled planets. All this will be done while waging war against AI, who will take the
                              same actions against you.</p>
                        <p>This project started as a class coding project but then quickly transformed into a personal
                              one. The main goals were the programming of autonomous agents and pathfinding. State
                              machines control ship behavior, with each state having a unique set of behaviors related
                              to ally and enemy ships to make them orbit, travel, and battle in realistic ways. Progress
                              has been good so far, and I hope to begin making levels once enemies are able to behave on
                              their own.</p>

                        <h4><strong>Status:</strong> In Development, Near-Completion </h4>
                        <h4><strong>Time frame:</strong> March 2023</h4>
                        <h4><strong>Engine Used:</strong> Canvas (JavaScript) </h4>

                        <p>This is a work in progress audio visualizer that I went way above the requirements of for a
                              school project. It was built using canvas with JavaScript, which essentially only gives me
                              access to simplistic drawing functions. I've bundled and transpiled the project using NPM
                              and Babel in the command line, so this visualizer should work using ES6 as well as ES5.
                        </p>

                        <p>The largest challenge of this project was of course making the sphere. It is an completely 2D
                              object, I've essentially programmed a third dimension for it to act upon. It is completely
                              made up of points, rather than arcs, and I rotate those points around the center of the
                              object using trig functions. The color of the line changes as the z-values of the points
                              become negative, and I use a spherical interpolation formula to add two point on each ring
                              where z = 0 every frame in order to make that axis seem consistent. It was not an easy
                              thing to figure out but it held my interests for long enough that I found a way to do it.
                        </p>
                        <p>This project is near completion. The only major areas of focus are cleaning up the UI to be
                              more supportive of users and finding a better way to portray itself to users and let them
                              choose their own music. I also wish to change how waveform data is displayed, as it comes
                              across as a bit chaotic currently.</p>

                              Whether it be enemy ships or the Kuiper belt, you won't stop fighting until someone takes
                              you down for good.

                        <p>Spaceway Skirmish class project whose primary goal was the introduction to Unity Engine. The
                              goal was to make a shoot-em-up with a scoring system. The only real requirements were to
                              have enemies and be able to fight them, so I went pretty far beyond the goal to involve
                              parallax and animations, which let me gain a general understanding of the sprite editor
                              and workflow. The most complex thing I did was create a system so that no enemies would
                              overlap, which involved writing a sorting algorithm to put them in order so that it could
                              quickly be identified where open space was. All things considered, it is a relatively
                              small project, but it helped build a greater understanding of how to program with
                              components, as compared to the hierarchical nightmare I was used to with MonoGame.
